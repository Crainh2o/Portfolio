    <p>I was born in Dallas,TX and raised in South Carolina. I became a Georgia Peach at 10 years old. I Graduated high school, currently still seeking higher education. I applied to WGU they have a bachelors and masters program togther. Praying that I get in. I got married in 2021 to my wonderful husband Darian. We have two amazing kids. Dylan is 4, and Devyn is 6 months. I have been in the tech field for about 8 years. Mostly working with SMS and VOIP.</p>
    
    <p>I was laid off during my maternity leave in 2022. After filling out countless applications and rejection after rejection. I heard about this program with Interapt. I did the required steps to get accepted and now I'm here. Its funny how what you say becomes full circle. Growing up my top two jobs were being a nurse, and a coder. Now at 35 I'm learning coding. Its never to late to start something new! Praying after I pass this program, I can finally get hired. I miss working even though I'm enjoying being home with my family.</p>
